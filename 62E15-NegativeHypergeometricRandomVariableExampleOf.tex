Suppose you have 7 black marbles and 10 white marbles in a jar.  You pull marbles until you have 3 black marbles in your hand.  $X$ would represent the number of white marbles in your hand.
\begin{list}{$\star$ }{}
\item The expected value of $X$ would be $E[X] = \frac{Wb}{B+1} = \frac{3(10)}{7+1} = 3.75$
\item The variance of $X$ would be $Var[X] = \frac{Wb(B-b+1)(W+B+1)}{(B+2)(B+1)^2} = \frac{10(3)(7-3+1)(10+7+1)}{(7+2)(7+1)^2} = 1.875$
\item The probability of having 3 white marbles would be $f_X(3) = \frac{{3+b-1 \choose 3}{W+B-b-3 \choose W-3}}{{W+B \choose W}} = \frac{{3+3-1 \choose 3}{10+7-3-3 \choose 10-3}}{{10+7 \choose 10}} = 0.1697$
