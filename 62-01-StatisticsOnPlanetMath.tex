\begin{document}
This entry is supposed to become a textbook on statistics -- or 
at least a guide to the statistics-related entries on PlanetMath.
It will refer to related entries (e.g. from probability) that
are not listed in the same MSC.

(This is currently a stub article. See also Textbook projects on PlanetMath.)
