\begin{document}
Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be iid as $X$ with (unknown) distribution function $F$.  Let $\omega$ be the outcome and $F_n(x,\omega)$ be the empirical distribution function based on observations $X_1(\omega),\ldots,X_n(\omega)$.  Then, as $n\rightarrow\infty$,
$$\sup_{-\infty<x<\infty}|F_n(x,\omega)-F(x)|\rightarrow 0\mbox{ a.s.},$$
where a.s. means almost surely.
