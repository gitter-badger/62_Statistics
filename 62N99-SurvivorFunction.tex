Let $Y$ be a random variable with cumulative probability distribution function $F_Y(y)$.  Then the \emph{survivor function} $S(y)$ is defined to be:
$$S(y) = 1 - F_Y(y) = P(Y\geq y).$$
The random variable $Y$ is often called the \emph{survival time}.

The survivor function is the probability of survival beyond time $Y=y$.

\textbf{Examples.} The three most commonly used distribution functions for survival time are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \PMlinkname{exponential distribution}{ExponentialRandomVariable}, with $S(y)=\exp(-\gamma y).$
\item Weibull distribution, with $S(y)=\exp(-y^{\gamma})$ using the standard Weibull distribution.
\item extreme-value distribution, with $S(y)=\exp(-\exp(\displaystyle{\frac{y-\alpha}{\beta}})).$
\end{enumerate}
