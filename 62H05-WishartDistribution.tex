\begin{document}
Let $U_i \sim  N_p(\mu_i, \Sigma ), \quad i=1,\ldots, k$ be independent $p$-dimensional random variables, which are
\PMlinkname{multivariate normally distributed}{jointnormaldistribution}. 
Let $S= \sum_{i=1}^k U_i {U_i}^T$. Let $M$ be the $k\times p$ matrix
with $\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_k$ as rows. 
Then the joint distribution of the
elements of $S$ is said to be a \emph{Wishart distribution on} $k$ 
\emph{\PMlinkescapetext{degrees} of freedom }, and is 
denoted by $W_p(k, \Sigma, M)$. If $M=0$, the distribution is said to be
\emph{central} and is denoted by $W_p(k, \Sigma)$. 
The Wishart distribution is a multivariate generalization  of the $\chi^2$ distribution. 

$W_p$ has a density function when $k \geq p$.
